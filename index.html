        <h2 class="m3 center h2 italic">About me</h2>
        <p class="m3 h3 bold">I am an unconventional leader who practices radical problem solving by combining culture change, technology advances, and â€Žmultidisciplinary knowledge.</p>
            <p class="m3  ampstart-dropcap">The world is a fascinatingly complex place, with opportunities to learn at every turn. Continuous learning and diverse interests are central to everything I do. That includes exploring the latest web technology, slowing things down with vintage camera lenses, and learning the ins and outs of good espresso.</p>
            <p class="m3 ">I am passionate about open source technology, with over a million combined downloads of my projects. I publish software under the name <b>devadvance</b>. This includes software like RootCloak, SMS Backup Reader, and more.</p>
            <p class="m3 ">I lead the Jersey City Innovation Center at BNY Mellon, where I engage employees, clients, and the startup community to shape how the company approaches its digital transformation. I simultaneously present thought leadership to client CXOs, engage hands-on with engineers, and establish new ways to partner with technology leaders.</p>
            <p class="m3 ">Prior to jumping into the working world, I received a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science and a Bachelors of Arts degree in Spanish at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
