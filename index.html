            <p>My name is Matt. I&apos;m into technology, photography, cooking, traveling, exploring new ideas and new cultures, thinking through interesting technology and business problems, and more. I believe in progress through research, technology, and learning, and above all else, enjoying the journey from start to finish.
            </p>
            <p>The world is a fascinatingly complex place, with opportunities to learn at every turn. These days, I&apos;m playing around with data visualizations, web components, and mirrorless photography with vintage lenses.</p>

            <p>I currently work at BNY Mellon, one of the largest financial institutions in the world. I work on a combination of business architecture and technology problems, with the fundamental goal of exploring problems in both areas and finding truly innovating solutions.</p>
            <p>Prior to jumping into the working world, I studied Computer Science and Spanish at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>

        <h2>Geek</h2>
        <p>I love technology. Whether it&apos;s coding up this site, testing a new product, researching scalable NoSQL clusters, or experimenting with user experience, technology is my passion. Bring it on.</p>

        <h2>Photographer</h2>
        <p>With patience and practice, photography gives me a chance to see anything from a different perspective, from portraits to landscapes, and everything in between. I am currently shooting a full frame mirrorless with manual Leica and Canon FD lenses.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 about-me-box">
        <h2>Cook</h2>
        <p>The most difficult question to be asked: &quot;What's your favorite food?&quot; Middle Eastern, Indian, Chinese, Latin&mdash;you name it. I love eating and cooking them all.</p>

        <h2>Fitness Guy</h2>
        <p>While I don&apos;t believe in going crazy over it, a healthy body is part of a healthy mind. A balance of gym-going, good food, and general fitness will affect your life in a positive way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 about-me-box">
        <h2>Explorer</h2>
        <p>New is always interesting. I love to explore; whether it&apos;s being open to new ideas, traveling to unlikely places, or trying a new restaurant around the block.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 about-me-box">
        <h2>Reader</h2>
        <p>A healthy mixture of books, news articles, and wiki articles go a long way. Continuous learning and knowledge keeps my brain happy.</p>
