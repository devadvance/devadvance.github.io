        <p class="dropcap">The world is a fascinatingly complex place, with opportunities to learn at every turn. Continuous learning and diverse interests are central to everything I do. That includes exploring the latest web technology, slowing things down with vintage camera lenses, and learning the ins and outs of good espresso.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about open source technology, with over a million combined downloads of my projects. I publish software under the name <b>devadvance</b>. This includes software like RootCloak, SMS Backup Reader, and more.</p>
        <p>I&apos;m the Senior Engineering Manager for the Transit team at Intersection, where we create beautifully designed experiences to deliver the right information in simple, engaging formats. You can <a href="https://go.mattj.io/ixn-transit" target="_blank">click here to learn more</a> about Transit at Intersection.</p>
        <p>Prior to Intersection, I led the Jersey City Innovation Center and oversaw the development of the API Platform for BNY Mellon, a global financial institution.</p>
        <p>Prior to jumping into the working world, I received a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science and a Bachelors of Arts degree in Spanish at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
