        <p class="dropcap">The world is a fascinatingly complex place, with opportunities to learn at every turn. Continuous learning and wide-ranging interests are central to everything I do. That includes exploring the latest web technology, slowing things down with vintage camera lenses, and learning the ins and outs of good espresso.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about open source technology, with over a million combined downloads of my projects. I publish software under the name <b>devadvance</b>. This includes software like RootCloak, SMS Backup Reader, Terminal Cheat Sheet, and more.</p>
        <p>I&apos;m an Engineering Manager at Google Stadia, where we build amazing gaming experiences at scale.</p>
        <p>Prior to Google, I led the <a href="https://go.mattj.io/ixn-transit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transit/IxNConnect</a> team at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(company)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intersection</a>, where we created beautifully designed experiences to deliver the right information in simple, engaging formats. I also led the Jersey City Innovation Center and oversaw the development of the API Platform for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank_of_New_York_Mellon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNY Mellon</a>, a global financial institution.</p>
