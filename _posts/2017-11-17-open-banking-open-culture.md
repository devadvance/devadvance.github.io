In November 2017, I participated in an interview with Forbes contributor [Tom Groenfeldt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} about open-source software and open culture in financial services. The resulting article, titled [_Open Banking Starts With Opening Bank Culture_](https://web.archive.org/web/20210823223710/https://stadia.dev/blog/overview-of-stadias-tv-app-architecture/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, touches on a lot of important areas. I am a firm believer in the value of open source and the impact it has. The first open source project at BNY Mellon is covered in my post, [_Open sourcing our first project at BNY Mellon_](/posts/2017-10-13-open-sourcing-our-first-project-at-bny-mellon/){:target="_blank"}.

You can read the article on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/11/15/open-banking-starts-with-opening-bank-culture/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
