In January 2018, we hosted a group of individuals for a "Winternship" program at BNY Mellon. This program involved hosting five freshman/sophomore women for a two-week technology internship.

A summary of the program, titled _BNY Mellon Hosts Winternship Program to Help Advance Women in Technology_, was originally available on the BNY Mellon website. It can now be found on the secondary website [MarketScreener](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-NEW-YORK-MELLON-C-11848/news/Bank-of-New-York-Mellon-BNY-Mellon-Hosts-Winternship-Program-to-Help-Advance-Women-in-Technology-25965096/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
