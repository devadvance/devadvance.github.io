In December 2016, I participated in a panel at General Assembly (GA) NYC called _The Future of Finance_ along with other members of the financial services industry.

An archive link of a written summary of the panel is available from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20170624001014/https://generalassemb.ly/blog/fintech-innovation-blockchain-panel-at-general-assembly/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, written by [Akiva Weiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akivaweiss){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
