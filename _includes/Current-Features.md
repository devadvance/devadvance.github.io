* Country code selection. You may have a contact stored one way, but when the SMS comes in, it may have the full international prefix and country code, even if it is from that same country you are in. Entering the country code of your number helps solve some of this problem.
* Separate message threads for each contact.
* "Sent" and "Received" and date/time information for each message.
* Export all conversations as a single text file divided by contact (easy archiving for later reading/printing).
* International support (UTF-8)
