# Known Issues
* Issue reading some backup files. Probably due to certain cases of formatting (Such as an email address instead of a number)
* Poorly formatted XML files will cause the program to do nothing when you click load (for example, if "&#0" is in the XML file). This is a null character and shouldn't be there. Working on a way to ignore it

# (Eventual) To-dos
* Country code drop down instead of entering manually
* Read other backups. (Call Log, APN, etc).
