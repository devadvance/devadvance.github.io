# Laser cutting and engraving

## Lightburn test file downloads

These are Lightburn test files that I created. They are designed to be easy to use and modify.

### Interval test

This test is used to compare different line intervals, also known as lines per inch (LPI). The line interval setting changes how close together each pass of the laser is. You can read more about line interval settings on the [Lightburn forum](https://forum.lightburnsoftware.com/t/image-engraving-guidelines/12913){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

### Power and speed test

This test is used to compare power and speed settings. Each shape uses a dedicated layer to maximize compatibility with different controllers.

This is an ornament I created with space for adding a name. This version uses a support bar beneath the name to make updates very easy. The file includes basic instructions for changing the name.

Pre-requisites:

*   This file uses the Pacifico font. Either install the font from
    [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico/about](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico/about){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}
     or choose a different font.

Instructions:

1.  Change the name text as desired. If necessary, change the size of the name
    text.
2.  Use the Boolean Union tool to combine the name text with the support bar
    beneath.
3.  (Optional) For characters like 'i', you may want to create a custom shape
    linking the dot with the rest of the letter. If you don't mind the missing
    dot, you can skip this step.
4.  Adjust your cut/layer settings for your machine.
5.  Use the Preview tool to validate that everything appears correct.
6.  Cut!
