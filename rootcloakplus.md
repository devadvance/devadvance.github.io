**Removed from the Play Store and no longer being actively developed! RootCloak Plus requires Cydia Substrate to work, which is no longer working after Android v4.3. Additionally, SafetyNet is becoming more prevalent.**

Some apps, such as banking, enterprise, or audio/video apps will not run if your phone is rooted. This allows you to run apps that detect root without disabling root. It is published under the name **devadvance**.
