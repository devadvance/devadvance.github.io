This is the repository for my personal site, currently hosted at [https://mattj.io](https://mattj.io)

This site is built using:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [PureCSS](https://purecss.io)
* And a bunch of custom HTML, CSS, and markdown

It requires [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) as the processor.
